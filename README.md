# Setup
Run the following to ensure you have the right packages:
`pip install pandas matplotlib scipy`

# Usage
Run `python kmeans.py` to get started.

When the program runs, you'll be prompted to enter 4 variables:
- Filename (the file used for analysis)
- K (the max amount of clusters that will be analyzed)
- Epsilon (the cutoff threshold for cluster errors between runs)
- Iterations (the max amount of analytical iterations for each cluster)

The dataset we ran our analysis on, and wrote our report over, is called "fruitfly.arff"
